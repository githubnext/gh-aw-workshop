# Side Quest: Environment Reference

> _Optional: use this quick glossary and visual reference to understand the environments and AI tools used throughout the workshop._

**What you'll learn:** By the end of this page you can name each tool and environment used in the workshop, match it to its role, and know when you'll use it.

## :clipboard: Before You Start

This is a reference page — you can read it any time. Come back here whenever the workshop uses a term you want to clarify. No terminal required to read this page.

When you're ready to verify your tools are working, see the [Checkpoint](#white_check_mark-checkpoint) section at the bottom.

## Environment and tool glossary

Knowing which name maps to which role helps you follow workshop instructions without stopping to wonder what "the terminal" or "Codespaces" means in context.

| Term | What it means in this workshop | When you use it | Official documentation |
|------|------|------|------|
| **GitHub Codespaces** | Your cloud development environment when you choose the browser-based setup path. Pre-launched in golden-ticket workshops. | Steps 2–14: writing, compiling, and running workflows | [GitHub Codespaces docs](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces) |
| **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** | The editor experience inside Codespaces (and optionally on your local machine). | Editing workflow files and reading output | [Visual Studio Code docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs) |
| **Terminal (command line)** | The shell where you run workshop commands (`gh`, `gh aw`, `git`, and more). | Any step that shows a `bash` code block | [GitHub CLI manual](https://cli.github.com/manual/) |
| **GitHub CLI (`gh`)** | GitHub's official CLI, required for this workshop. Pre-installed in the Codespace. | Starting at Step 6 (install the extension) | [GitHub CLI docs](https://cli.github.com/manual/) |
| **`gh-aw` CLI extension** | The GitHub Agentic Workflows extension you install and use in the terminal to compile workflow files. | Step 6 onward | [Install `gh-aw`](https://github.com/github/gh-aw#readme) |
| **GitHub Copilot CLI** | Copilot in the terminal for AI-assisted command and development help. The primary AI surface in this workshop. | Any step that shows a `prompt` code block | [GitHub Copilot CLI docs](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/copilot-cli/about-copilot-cli) |
| **GitHub Copilot app** | The GitHub Copilot desktop and web application where you can open repositories, start agent sessions, steer coding tasks, and manage pull requests. | Optional; side quests cover this surface | [GitHub Copilot app](https://github.com/features/ai/github-app) |
| **Claude** | Anthropic's AI model family available in some GitHub Copilot and agentic workflow contexts. | Steps that use a non-default model | [Claude documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/) |
| **OpenAI Codex** | OpenAI coding model family that can be used in coding and agent workflows. | Steps that use a non-default model | [OpenAI Codex CLI repository](https://github.com/openai/codex#readme) |

> [!NOTE]
> **GitHub Enterprise (GHES/GHEC) users**: the same tools and commands apply in enterprise environments. Your Codespace URL and GitHub URLs will use your enterprise hostname instead of `github.com`. If your enterprise uses a self-hosted runner, the `gh aw compile` command still runs locally in your Codespace — see [Step 6](06-install-gh-aw.md) for any environment-specific install notes.

### :dart: Quick check — match the tool to its role

Before moving on, try matching each item to its role from memory, then reveal the answer.

**1.** Which tool compiles agentic workflow files in the terminal?

<details>
<summary>Reveal answer</summary>

The **`gh-aw` CLI extension** — you install it in [Step 6](06-install-gh-aw.md) and run `gh aw compile`.

</details>

**2.** Which surface gives you AI help directly inside the terminal?

<details>
<summary>Reveal answer</summary>

**GitHub Copilot CLI** — the primary AI surface used throughout this workshop.

</details>

**3.** Which environment is pre-launched for you in golden-ticket workshops and hosts your editor and terminal in the browser?

<details>
<summary>Reveal answer</summary>

**GitHub Codespaces**.

</details>

**4.** Which tool manages GitHub-specific terminal tasks like authentication checks and repository shortcuts?

<details>
<summary>Reveal answer</summary>

**GitHub CLI (`gh`)**.

</details>

**5.** Which desktop/web app lets you start agent sessions and review pull requests outside the terminal?

<details>
<summary>Reveal answer</summary>

The **GitHub Copilot app**.

</details>

**6.** Name one non-default AI model family this workshop mentions besides the default.

<details>
<summary>Reveal answer</summary>

**Claude** or **OpenAI Codex** — used in steps that select a non-default model.

</details>

### :white_check_mark: Verify your tools are ready

Open a terminal in your Codespace and run:

```bash
gh --version
git --version
```

Both commands should print a version number. If either fails, see [Set Up a Codespace](02a-setup-codespace.md).

> [!NOTE]
> `gh aw --version` only works after you complete [Install the gh-aw CLI Extension](06-install-gh-aw.md). Skip that check until you reach Step 6.

After you complete Step 6, also run:

```bash
gh aw --version
```

These simplified mental models (not literal product screenshots) help you recognize each name when it appears in later steps.

### Development environments

#### GitHub Codespaces and VS Code

Codespaces gives you a ready-to-go development environment in your browser, built on the same VS Code editor experience shown below.

#### Terminal (command line)

  <img alt="Conceptual screenshot of a terminal showing a prompt, commands, and command output" src="images/side-quest-01-02-terminal-light.svg">
</picture>

You use the terminal whenever the workshop asks you to run `gh`, `gh aw`, or `git` commands.

### Workshop tools and model options

#### GitHub CLI (`gh`) and `gh-aw` extension

  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="images/side-quest-01-02-gh-cli-dark.svg">

</picture>

`gh` handles GitHub-specific terminal tasks (auth, repo shortcuts); the `gh-aw` extension adds `gh aw compile` for agentic workflow files.

#### GitHub Copilot CLI and app

  <img alt="Conceptual screenshot of GitHub Copilot CLI showing a terminal prompt alongside AI-assisted command help" src="images/side-quest-01-02-copilot-cli-light.svg">
</picture>

Copilot CLI gives you AI help inside the terminal; the Copilot app (below) lets you start and steer repository sessions, manage coding tasks, and review pull requests from a browser or desktop workspace.

#### Claude and OpenAI Codex

Claude and OpenAI Codex are non-default AI model options available in some steps — both read a brief and produce a response or code patch.
